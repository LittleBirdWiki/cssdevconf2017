## Talk

### What do you think about the state of the web?

- Building for stuff on the web these days is like a monkey paw because we get one thing (i.e., CSS Grid) but we also get other things (i.e., Webpack)
- Been trying not to use Sass as much and avoiding JavaScript frameworks
    - By doing so, it proves to be this interesting challenge of "Can I make a website without 70,000 npm libraries and so forth?"

### Give a small version of your experience about transitioning to a Windows machine

- Two years ago, he was on the Mac stack.
- They were getting a lot of questions about things like "How do I get Sketch?" and their answer at the time was pretty much "Get a Mac."
- But this is very expensive especially in other countries and this eventually inspired him to try and figure out how to do things on PC
- This turned out to be a pretty harrowing experience because things didn't work as the documentation said it would
- Felt like the Window ethos matched him, but there were a lot of unknowns because so much of the documentation is geared towards people on Mac
- Using Edge and IE everyday has changed his perspective a bit. Edge is his go to browser.
    - When using Chrome all the time, he had a number of little moments that started converted him over to IE

### What do you think about the redesign progress of your website?

- Using CSS variables on it which he approves of
- I'm using CSS Grid, but I think I'm doing it terribly.
- If you build a product that's coming out a long time from now, you get to play with a lot of new things!
- Jason wants the web to be beautiful, but our process has chipped away at the soul of web
- Struggling with the weight he's adding and the performance...
- Your personal site is a reprensentation of what you like about the web and a place for you to experiment with things
- There needs to be an easy way for you to let your thoughts out

### What do you think of the theme this conference?

- CSS Grid & Pattern libraries have been consistently talked about
- 3rd Party Analytics and Tag Managers has been a pretty big topic of conversation as well

### Brief Discussion on Solutions to A/B Testing

- Study library is written in JavaScipt that can be rendered on the server and client
- [DollarShave Club repo](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub) is pretty cool

### How do you deal with the negative aspects of open source?

- "Chicken Soup for the Open Source Soul" by Dave Rupert
- Imagine you are hanging out with your friends at 11PM on Saturday and get an email from some random user saying how the project sucks because you don't respond immediately to their needs.
- Should consider a "Looking for Maintainer" flag when you're done with a project
- And if you publish it to npm, that's a whole different Horcrux you have to deal with
