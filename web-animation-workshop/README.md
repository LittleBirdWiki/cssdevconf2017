**When:** October 11th, 2017 from 10:00AM to 5:00PM

**Where:** New Orleans, Louisiana

## Description

Get up and running with web animation in less time than it would take to read all the tutorials you have bookmarked. In this workshop, you'll get an in-depth look at animating with CSS, JavaScript, and SVG through hands-on exercises while learning how to make your project stand out from the competition with effective animation.

By coding along with Sarah and Val in this workshop, youâ€™ll learn:

- The essentials of CSS animation
- Principles of UI/UX for animation
- Basics of TweenMax and TimelineMax
- SVG workflow and optimization
- SVG animation, both with a library and without

Sarah and Val will also show you:

- How to choose which web animation technologies are best for your projects, with an overview of the animation landscape, explaining which tools to choose and why
- What CSS transforms, transitions and keyframe animations can do and how to use them effectively in your work
- Best practices and principles to follow to ensure the animations you create are adding something positive to the user experience, not distracting from it.
- How to bend SVGs to your will- both regarding optimization and performance, as well as creating dazzling visual effects that bring your project to life.

## Memorable Quotes

> "Why does it work like this? I'm sure there's a reason, but I'm going to yell about it anyways." - Val Head

> "They don't pay me. I'm just a developer that found a tool I like." - Sarah Drasner on GreenSock

> "Animation cannot fix your bad design." - Val Head

> "Since we're in JavaScript, we don't have to worry about the [CSS] spec." - Sarah Drasner joke about filters being unanimatable with CSS

> "This is not an animatable property. GreenSock, do you worst." - Sarah Drasner

## Presentation Notes

- Great use of multiple screen capture GIFs in a single slide in order to slow the differences between different browsers
- Great use of the zoom animation in order to make text more visible
- Phenomenal CodePen where she has the code for the animation appear as the relative animation happens which is great for context
- Hilarious use of GIF for "how I feel when I live code, but I'll do it anyways..."
- Great use of progressing through code by showing the manual way and then layering on the benefits with each iteration and how it solves X pain point
- The use of hover effect as "poking turtles" was cute
- So many awesome CodePen examples shows just how awesome the techniques are
