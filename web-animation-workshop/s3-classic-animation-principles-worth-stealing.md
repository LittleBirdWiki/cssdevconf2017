# Theory: Classic Animation Principles Worth Stealing w/ Val Head

- "The 12 Principles of Animation" was created by Disney
    - They are related concepts to help your animation become more life-like or simply communicate more effectively
- The Principles We'll Cover Today
    - Timing & Spacing
    - Follow Through & Overlapping Action
    - Anticipation
    - Squash & Stretch
    - Staging
    - Arcs
    - Exaggeration

## Timing & Spacing

- It used to be just called "Timing," but nowadays it's more commonly referred as "Timing & Spacing"
- **Pro Tip:** If you only have room for one animation principle to remember, this is the one!
- The only way to get good at it though is to practice it
- Timing (aka `duration`): The amount of time it takes for an action to happen aka the duration
- Spacing (aka `easing`): The changes in speed over the uration of the action's timing
- The reason it matters is because:
    - It makes animated objects appear to obey the laws of physics
    - Establishes the mood, emotion and reaction
- Had an awesome example of triangles and circles communicating a narrative
- Even though cubic-bezier curves seem complicated, just remember that all you're doing is determining how fast something is going over a certain span of time. Definitely use the cubic-bezier tool for designing a custom one though!

## Follow Through & Overlapping Action

- Follow Through
    - Not everything comes to a stop at once
    - Helps give the impression that something is obeying the laws of physics
    - Different parts of the "body" move at different rates 
- Overlapping Action
    - Actions don't wait for the one before it to finish before starting
    - Movements tend to overlap in time

## Anticipation

- This is the reverse of follow through in that there is a little hesitation before the main movement
- Setting up, preparing or getting ready for the main movement
- Using opposite movement in order to draw attention to it and make it more weightier
- Very often used for exits 
- Often coupled with follow throughs

## Arcs

- Organic movements typically don't follow straight lines of motion
- Very hard to do in interfaces because the most efficient calculation computers can do is a straight-line action
- Fun thing to check out: Browsers implement different animations for downloading items

## Exaggeration

- The "truth" but more extreme
- Actions are made bigger and more drastic for greater effect and impact
- Great example of Mickey Mouse pulling this huge hammer out of his pocket which could not have possibly fit in his pocket, but it draws the correct attention and delivers the message clearly of what the animator wants you to focus on without being off putting

## Squash & Stretch

- Gives the illusion of weight and flexibility of an object
- Objects tend to change shape as they move depending on inertia and the elasticity of what they're made of
- Important to maintain the volume of the object
- Gives the illusion of the element being some natural material
- Cool example of a drippy hamburger menu on a site for Animal

## Staging

- It's classically defined as a way to make a scene clear, but this should already be our focus as UI designers / developers. 
- Instead, think of it more as directing the audience's attention, and making it clear what is of greatest importance in a scene
- Examples of..
    - Dark Sky app loading with the black circle being staged and then turned into the temperature when it's done loading
    - A Plus Icon rotating to the right to take your attention out into the menu that expands out after clicking it. Love this example!
- When motion design on the screen follows real life, it makes the experience that much better
