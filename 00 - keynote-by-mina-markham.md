## Talk - "Saving the World with CSS"

- Worked on Hilary Clinton's website for the recent campaign
- Got contacted through a rather generic email asking about working for a "social good issue"
- Completely left behind her life in Austin to join this venture
- "An 18-month, nationally televised hackathon"
- Was asked to create a "Bootstrap" that ended up being called "Pantsuit" because there were multiple codebases ran by different teams but needed to share one UI
- She was the only person managing the entire pattern library
- Took approximately 6 weeks to finish the first version of Pantsuit
- "Technical debt is your 'friend'" - It is not always a bad thing to have technical debt because it can be used strategically to hit deadlines
- Used CSS Audit and UI Inventory to generate style guide
- Her workflow was to: Define -> Implement -> Test -> Iterate -> (Re)define
- Responsible for making sure the site was accessible
- Was conscious about the size of the library and tried to keep it as modular as possible to allow teams to pick and choose what they wanted to ingest
- Almost quit when things went south and she accidentally broke the site when Hilary announced to go to the site and there were issues
- Had people actively trying to actively ruin her life (i.e., a Reddit post talking about hacking her and putting her down)
- Pantsuit was never open-sourced because people would actively use it to impersonate them and generate lots of misleading news (e.g., there was a Reddit post trying to locate the fonts in order to make stuff)
- At the end of it all, she still believes it was worth it
