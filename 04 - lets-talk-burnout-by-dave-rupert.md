## Talk

- #1 Rule for a Safe Discussion: No throwing coworkers under the bus
- Act 1: A Case Study
    - You feel like you're designing / building the same thing over and over
- Act 2: Causes & Effects
    - Suggestions to Causes of Burnout w/ Audience Participation:
        - The fear that it is never going to go away
        - No vacation
        - Constantly having to learn something else
        - Feeling of control over your work
        - Never really being off work since you're constantly hustling
        - Endless firefighting
        - All people see is that things don't ship and miss all the work that has been put into it so far
        - The feeling that your work is insignificant in relation to what is going on with the rest of the world
        - Under representation, sexism & racism are concerns that are draining to people. 
            - "Sometimes I want to see someone else that looks like me."
        - As a freelancer, fear of leaving money on the table and not being able to say no to anything as a result
- Act 3: Prevention & Cures
    - Boundaries to help signal when things have gone too far
    - Safety valve as far as giving you breaks from the work that's growing dull. Example of working on a project for 4 weeks and then getting a day to do whatever you want
    - Being conscious about whether what you're doing is causing other people stress (i.e., Talking about things to do on Slack that stresses other people out)
    - Having "tribes" of people that do something completely unrelated to the day to day
    - Being cognizant of time zones when pinging people
    - Recovery takes longer than people realize
    - Go into the woods with no devices
    - Getting perspective on projects by talking to people outside your project
